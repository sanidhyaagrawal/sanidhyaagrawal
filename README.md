### Hi there, I'm Sanidhya ðŸ‘‹

<b><i>
I enjoy finding solutions to a myriad of different problems which are empowered by code and creativity. I believe, it is a sophisticated skill to possess and would help me work harder and approach any problem with a unique perspective.

I first got into programming when I was 13; I saw a video on YouTube on how to make a BB-8 robot (from star wars) using Arduino, some motors, an HC-05 Bluetooth chip, which could be controlled with a mobile application. I didn't know anything about electronics at the time, but I still saved up my pocket money and bought all of these things. I never built the BB-8 but tinkering with Arduino and working with various sensors made me feel like a magician. I could make lights dance to music, control them by clapping, and I have not stopped from then to now.
